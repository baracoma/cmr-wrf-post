# cmr-wrf-post
Collection of scripts used to post-process WRF outputs for Cordillera Mountain Range topography experiments

Modeling, post-processing, and generating plots, was done JASMIN , the UK's collaborative data analysis environment (https://jasmin.ac.uk).

Environment and packages used for post-processing are listed in requirements.txt and wrfenv.yaml

WRF geographic input (geo_em_d0*.nc), as well as configuration files (namelist.input, namelist.wps) are included in the wrf_config folder.
